<h1>Python Files<h1>
<h5>I have created 2 python scripts i.e evenNumber.js and oddNumberInName.js</h5>
 <p>-evenNumber.js: In this file, a loop is created which is pushing the elements in the list if it is even and a number is taken as input till which the loop will generate even numbers.</p>
 <p>-oddNumberInName.js: In this file, First and last name is taken as input and a loop is created to get the off numbers after which the list of odd numbers will be reversed. Two loops are simultaneously implemented to get these number embedded between the first and last name and return the result as the corresponding list</p>
